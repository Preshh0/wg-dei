<span id="anchor-120"></span>October 14, 2019

Agenda:

  - Issues review and replies
  - Consider is the naming of the "Success Metrics" heading
  - Open Source Summit Lyon presentations we have

Attendees: Dawn, Matt S., Shuah K.

Video: No one attending had access to record the session.

Notes:

  - Issues review and replies
    
      - > [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/)

  - Consider is the naming of the "Success Metrics" heading
    
      - > Georg suggestion: I'll comment on the "Success Metric" in the
        > template - maybe we can iterate and discuss on the mailing
        > list. The term "success metrics" is confusing because we call
        > the whole page a metric, e.g., "Speaker Diversity". Within the
        > D\&I WG, we then have multiple ways of measuring this metric
        > with what we call "success metrics". Multiple metrics inside
        > of a single metric can seem confusing.
    
      - > We have "strategies for collecting data" - which is a list
        > like "interviews and surveys" - then we have the "success
        > metrics" that specify how the data is collected through
        > specific interview and survey questions.
    
      - > My proposal is to combine the two sections - we don't need to
        > duplicate the information and can subsume the questions and
        > details within the "strategies for collecting data" section.

  - Gris Cuevas from ASF had a lightning talk at CHAOSScon about the ASF
    D\&I Initiative. A D\&I survey will be conducted this year to
    measure the status quo at ASF. Interest in advancing D\&I survey
    questions was also voiced throughout OSSNA by different people. We
    may invite everyone to discuss survey design and review our
    metrics.?

Agenda/Notes:

  - CHAOSSCON meeting

  - Shuah talk on D\&I at OSS. 
    
      - > [*https://ossalsjp19.sched.com/event/QLxN/keynote-making-connections-new-developers-the-linux-kernel-community-shuah-khan-fellow-the-linux-foundation*](https://ossalsjp19.sched.com/event/QLxN/keynote-making-connections-new-developers-the-linux-kernel-community-shuah-khan-fellow-the-linux-foundation)

  - Discussion on Mentorship metric

  - Discussion on Communication Inclusivity metric.

Discussion about how to start conversations, how to start a community.
And how to bring new people just starting out of college or changing
careers. How can we help them to be part of the community to create a
community? 

  - There might be issues such as language barriers, engaging into
    discussion, effective communication.

Other aspects of diversity are important as well.

Potential input from Shuah: progress Shuah is doing, experiences and
share specific knowledge and expertise in the area.

**Notes on metrics**:

https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/leadership/mentorship.md

**How to gather information in the mentorship**.

Shuah is asking her students about the community:

\* how useful was the community?

\* were people useful for you? 

\* was the community welcoming

She's been collecting quotes after the initial selection after 6 weeks
and then after each of the three evaluation processes during the 12 week
program.

Educating and mentoring new developers. Staying patient while educating
and answering the same questions more than once. Developing FAQ
(Frequently Answered Questions).

\* This is going to be shared in her talk at the OSS Summit San Diego.

Track new contributors for each single release (each three months)

\* Tracking new developers that are women.

\* Did they have any help? Have they been through any mentorship
program? Do they want to mentor? 

\* They want to watch over time the retention angle. Continue
contributing to open source. Do they have an interest in keep
contributing?

\* This depends on the company although this depends.

Track existing documents? How can we keep track what Shuah is doing so
far?

**Communication Inclusivity**.

How to teach English speakers not to use jargon.

This is a big umbrella for effective communication in general. 

If I use jargon, newcomers may not feel comfortable asking for this
meaning in a public channel. Having a specific safe environment where
people can ask freely their specific questions about jargon meaning or
any other type of questions.

Implicit words vs explicit, way of working with the community. Avoid
subjective talks, humor, etc. This is not understood by newcomers.

It’s about empowering people asking questions freely in any channel so
they feel comfortable.

This jargon or tech. Vocabulary does not need to be ‘bad’ or ‘good’ by
itself, but this is a learning path. This is like moving to a new place
where you have to learn where things and places are. And how to bring
your own uniqueness to the place.

  - AI: Matt figure out who at the LF is doing D\&I work

  - AI: Nicole to reach back out to Hyperledger folks to find out what
    is going on with the Indy project

  - Working to advance the OSSNA D\&I session (Nicole and Georg)

  - Do we want to make a concerted effort to deploy D\&I Metrics? 
    
      - > Community manager summit (July 14th)
    
      - > Nicole could attend and present D\&I work 
        
          - Daniel will confirm 
          - Talk potential: Usage and application of the metrics --
            Identify or demonstrate pilot projects 
          - How can the metrics have an impact?

          - Mozilla and their use of CHAOSS work to inform their
            internal D\&I checklist:
            [*https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/blob/master/evaluation\_tools/governance-basic.md*](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/blob/master/evaluation_tools/governance-basic.md)

          - While these may not be direct 1-to-1 correlation of the
            CHAOSS metrics being deployed within a project, they
            demonstrate the impact that the CHAOSS D\&I workgroup is
            having in a short period of time
        
          - Other potential points of connection include:

      - > Next step:
        
          - **AI Georg:** Break out metric into its components: Common
            Metric, Contributor Community Diversity, and Recognition of
            Good Work
    
      - > Right now, we have too much in here and are juggling too many
        > parts
        
          - Component 1 (**Common Metric**): How to obtain contribution
            types and which contribution types exist is a universal
            problem that can live in the Common Metrics WG. Other WGs
            may have different angles on it and ask for example "How
            active is the community across contribution types"
          - Component 2 (**Recognition of Good Work**): We have
            contribution types in the focus area Recognition of Good
            Work and should create a document that tailors the metric
            specifically to recognition.
          - Component 3 (**Contributor Community Diversity**): We also
            have contribution types in the focus area Contributor
            Community Diversity and should create a document that
            tailors the metric specifically to understanding the
            diversity of our community members across contribution types

        > we can …
        
          - 1\. We can have a generic disclaimer in each incomplete
            focus area, that there are more under development and they
            can be found on the repository
            
              - > Way to get more contributors who are interested in
                > helping to develop incomplete metrics.
        
          - 2\. We can hold back the other 3 metrics for future
            releases.
        
          - 3\. We can include undeveloped metrics with a disclaimer
            that they are undeveloped.
    
      - > Should we focus on a specific metric for the first release?
        
          - We should do a walk-through of the focus areas and metrics
            to identify the “level of completeness”.
          - Then, we can decide whether to focus on the focus-areas that
            have the most complete OR to focus on metrics that could
            populate a less well developed focus area.
          - We will put this on next week’s agenda and prior discuss
            this on the mailing list.

          - **AI Sarah:** Send notes from meeting to D\&I mailing list
          - HL decentralized identity management with Indy, incorporate
            methods for reporting on D\&I. Once deployed with this tool,
            it will be available to other communities. 
          - First trial with Hyperledger community.
          - Next step is to meet with the Indy team
            (https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy).
    
      - > Panel Discussion on D\&I metrics at OSLS.
        
          - Panelists: Nicole, Sarah, Dawn and Georg.

            expectations for the following months and looking for
            piloting.
          - Ethics discussion, pilot use cases interesting to crowd.

          - Georg comment: requirements to become a pilot project, time
            involved, would be good to document this and post it so we
            can point people to it. Good discussion to also post to
            mailing list for wider input and further discussion.

          - D\&I 3 Focus Areas This Year 1) evolve the metrics based on
            community input, continue to work on them, 2) application of
            the metrics and the pilot projects and 3) socialization,
            promotion of the successes, increase visibility for CHOASS
            and the pilot project successes

          - Lots of discussion on D\&I, pilot use cases 
        
          - Lots of focus on Risk, what direction these metrics should
            take? 
            
              - > How did we come up with these metrics? goal, question,
                > objective, metrics to answer those questions

  - CHAOSS Community Handbook: within growing CHAOSS, newcomers, don’t
    know history, especially for someone new it can be difficult, not a
    lot documented with roles and responsibilities. 

  - Community Handbook idea - GitLab has published all their operations.
    Idea is to adopt that for CHAOSS and document how we operate. 

  - Several willing to help write it.

      - > Emmanuel, they were having a look at the metrics in CHAOSS,
        > contributions types, how to make a PR. They didn’t find a
        > proper way to include some metrics without moving things
        > around.
    
      - > Dawn: not all of the metrics might be part of D\&I. There are
        > other groups such as the commons working group, GMD, Risk, and
        > others. It might be worth having a look at this.
    
      - > Langdon: It was unclear the relationship between the overall
        > metrics and the D\&I metrics and how they relate to each
        > other. Was this intended?
        
          - Example of those metrics: responsiveness metrics such as
            time to xxx.
    
      - > There’s a document that they’ll share with the community to
        > have a look at and help with the process.
        
          - CHAOSS is still doing work in progress in terms of
            structuring all of the metrics and across all of the working
            groups.
    
      - > Example of metrics: communication channels and sentiment and
        > inclusivity in those channels. 

  - Determine the March 18th meeting facilitator and notetaker 
    
      - > Facilitator: Nicole as tentative facilitator
    
      - > Notetaker: Sarah Conway

  - OSLS panel
    
      - > Nicole will moderate the panel.
    
      - > Potential recommendations:
        
          - Slide with panelist introductions.
          - 1 Question per panelist and then there’s time for extra
            questions from the audience.

  - Participants: Ry Jones, Dawn Foster, Georg Link, Matt Germonprez,
    Langdon, Sarah Conway, Nicole Huesman, Lars Kiesow, Kevin Lumbard,
    Lars Kiesow

  - Ways to contribute for people not on a call
    
      - > The goal is to include people in the repository. Have events
        > or include in meeting minutes issues that anyone could pick up
        > to participate.
    
      - > We have loads of stuff on the issue tracker that anyone could
        > pick up. We need to explicitly encourage people to
        > participate. 
    
      - > People who are not on the call may feel that they are not up
        > to speed and have a barrier to contribute
    
      - > We should continue to use the “good first issue” tag on the
        > issue tracker
    
      - > Maybe have a regular email to mailing list with issues that we
        > would like help with.
        
          - **AI Sarah:** Send bi-weekly reminder of issues that we want
            help with. Bring this up during meeting to get ideas for
            what issues to include. Use overall CHAOSS mailing list.
    
      - > Rehash a conversation via an email thread that is unique to
        > one topic. Especially topics we could not conclude during a
        > meeting. Use CHAOSS mailing list for larger conversations 
        
          - Use D\&I list for updates, agenda, and organization issues
          - **AI Georg:** Start conversations on the CHAOSS mailing list
            on topics that bleed over from the weekly calls.
    
      - > The D\&I mailing list is missing on the
        > chaoss.community/participate section “mailing lists”
        
          - **AI Matt + Kevin:**
            [*https://github.com/chaoss/website/issues/118*](https://github.com/chaoss/website/issues/118)

  - Review last week’s Action Items
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** talk to Nicole whether she wants to be panelist
        > or moderator (OSLS)
        
          - Nicole is happy to do either, whatever is needed.
        
          - Jamie Smith is willing to take Daniel’s spot on the panel.
            
              - > **AI Sarah:** confirm with everyone that the switch
                > from Daniel to Jamie is okay for the OSLS panel.
        
          - Georg is taking Matt’s place on the panel
            
              - > **AI Sarah:** Update panelist bio section on OSLS
                > schedule. Georg replaces Matt, Jamie replaces Daniel.
        
          - **AI Nicole:** Schedule an OSLS panel planning meeting.
            Strategy for fitting this many people in a 30 minute panel.
    
      - > **AI Sarah:** Setup meeting with Hyperledger and CHAOSS D\&I
        
          - Ongoing. Hyperledger team meets internally first. 
          - At OSLS, include a remote join option for people who can’t
            be at the meeting
          - Hyperledger is very interested in using D\&I metrics.
            Working internally to get started, evaluating how to use
            CHAOSS metrics effectively and how to contribute back.
          - Invite for meeting at OSLS will come later this week.
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** Reach out to Uber and invite them to this
        > meeting as well
        
          - Open
    
      - > **AI Georg + Matt:** prepare a intern project description
        
          - Done:
            [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues/166*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues/166)
            
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** Create a pull request that add people who
        > contributed at CHAOSScon as contributors
        
          - Open
    
      - > **AI Nicole:** communicate with Ben on D\&I ReadMe file and
        > move content into these sections. 
        
          - Content update:
            
              - > [*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVtYHNTwrGFV3UyiR2qBKV0MvipoEEI-fbwavSNui4Q/edit*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVtYHNTwrGFV3UyiR2qBKV0MvipoEEI-fbwavSNui4Q/edit)
        
          - **AI Nicole:** Send email to overall CHAOSS mailing list to
            start review process
    
      - > **AI Nicole:** Submit PR with new readme file and review at
        > next meeting. 
        
          - After email-list review

  - Outreachy discussion 
    
      - > Question: The last two project ideas have an overlap with a
        > Boston University project. Concern is limited time from
        > mentors and adding more interns might spread mentors thin. 
        
          - The metrics chosen by BU students are: Communication and
            Pull Requests
          - BU goal is to implement with Augur and GrimoireLab and
            document different visualization and representation options.
          - BU has three part-time interns.
          - BU project may extend into summer and fall as an ongoing
            project for students to accomplish goals. Summer interns
            would be full-time.
          - **AI BU project: **Provides updates on weekly D\&I call.
    
      - > Decision: Wait for BU project to evolve and evaluate how much
        > work goes into mentoring before we add more interns.

  - Determine next week’s meeting facilitator and notetaker 
    
      - > Facilitate: Dawn Foster
    
      - > Notetaker: TBD at beginning of meeting

      - > Georg is replacing Matt 
    
      - > We can come up with some questions for the panel. If it makes

  - CHAOSS D\&I meeting at OSLS
    
      - > This is a CHAOSS D\&I meeting
    
      - > Invite Hyperledger 
    
      - > **AI Sarah:** Setup meeting with Hyperledger and CHAOSS D\&I

      - > **AI Daniel:** Reach out to Uber and invite them to this
        > meeting as well
    
      - > Question: how do we make the connection between CHAOSS D\&I WG
        > and projects that want to implement the metrics?
    
      - > How do we, firstly, get them aware of the project and,
        > secondly, become involved.
    
      - > Maybe we need a package or document on “how to get started
        > with D\&I metrics”
    
      - > Three possible methods:
        
          - CHAOSS D\&I members do the work of implementing D\&I metrics
            for communities. E.g., produce a gender report for a
            community
          - We have an Outreachy or other intern who does the D\&I
            implementation
          - CHAOSS D\&I members as consultants, providing guidance to a
            project, providing help but not doing work ourselves.
          - Find sponsoring (open call?) to have a full-time dedicated
            CHAOSS D\&I person who can be a liaison with projects

  - Outreachy intern follow up
    
      - > **AI Georg + Matt:** prepare a project description

  - BU + Red Hat Open Source Inclusion Update
    
      - > Two weeks ago, BU + Red Hat had a round table on what metrics
        > they wanted to work on
        > ([*graphic*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12HEtALiey93CCPYALeDLWLj6DuepDqF_/view?usp=sharing)).
        > Through a voting, two metrics were surfaced that the team is
        > thinking about working on. Question is now, whether the CHAOSS
        > D\&I Working Group has feedback on these metrics.
    
      - > Metrics would be integrated with Augur
    
      - > 1\. Metric: Communication channels + sentiment
        
          - Not yet defined in CHAOSS D\&I WG
          - [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/project-and-community/channels.md*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/project-and-community/channels.md)
          - Good starting point, needs defining, space for innovation
            and students can shape the outcome
    
      - > 2\. Metric: Pull requests and reviews on GitHub
        
          - Might be related to focus area “Recognition of Good Work” 
          - [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/focus-areas/recognition*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/focus-areas/recognition)
          - Not yet defined in CHAOSS D\&I Working Group
          - 
    
      - > Next steps: Dive into the metrics and what can be collected.
        > Talk to Augur about how already collected metrics can be used
        > for D\&I metrics. 
    
      - > Suggestion: Identify the goal first, irrespective of metric.
        > Work through several steps to work towards a metric. (Avoid
        > limiting search to metrics based on already available data).

  - Review last week’s action items:
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** Create a pull request that add people who
        > contributed at CHAOSScon as contributors
        
          - open

        > repository, on the long list of metrics, add column with what
        > WG works on each metric and link to the respective repo. This
        > week, working on D\&I metrics. Possible pull requests coming
        > to align e.g., naming. \[due: Thursday\]
        
          - Work in progress: https://github.com/germonprez/metrics
          - Goal: Common Metrics WG wants to identify important metrics
            that are not worked on in any other WG yet.

  - \[Objective \#5, KR1\] Update on metric release infrastructure
    
      - > Update from last week’s CHAOSS weekly hangout call: The
        > infrastructure is not decided on yet. The previous proposal
        > was 

  - \[Objective \#5, KR1\] Advancing metrics from CHAOSScon workshop
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** Review the google docs and decide whether they
        > are good enough for a pull request (and create a pull request)
        > otherwise, report back to meeting next week which metrics need
        > more work. Write a comment with conclusion on the respective

Notes:

  - Participants: Dawn Foster, Georg Link, Daniel Izquierdo, Sharan,
    Langdon, Sarah Conway, Emmanuel Amponsah, Matt Germonprez, Nicole
    Huesman, Kevin Lumbard

  - Review last week’s Action Items
    
      - > **AI Nicole: **Describe better how to get involved. Expand the
        > CONTRIBUTING.md
        
          - Open - postpone until next week 
    
      - > **AI All:** Weigh in on the structure by next week, using
        > comments in the Google Doc. **AI Nicole:** Send email to list
        > to ask for feedback on readme structure.
        
          - Posted to mailing list for feedback. A few comments were
            made on the document. Discussed more in later agenda item
    
      - > **AI Georg:** create new pull request
        > ([*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/158*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/158))
        
          - Sarah: Paid and non-paid adds more clarity
          - Sharan: tried to capture this too and saw it as a
            distinction worth capturing
          - Dawn: incredibly important to capture, need to consider how
            the info. Is used
          - Agreed to use language, Dawn to go ahead and merge 
    
      - > **AI Matt**: Look for funding for outreachy / GSoC
        
          - Matt: Not much luck with funding. 
          - Involve someone who can help us polish what we have, use
            cases that we have, work with more projects to implement
            metrics, could use someone to collect the information, write
            engaging blog posts. 
          - Red Hat and Linux Foundation may be able to support this in
            future. Red Hat has money earmarked for a project we have
            with Open Source & D\&I (and funds Outreachy interns in
            general). Would need more specifics - one paragraph - on
            what is needed. 
          - **AI Georg + Matt:** prepare a project description
    
      - > **AI Georg:** Create a Pull Request to add contributors to
        > readme
        
          - Done
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** Create a pull request that add people who
        > contributed at CHAOSScon as contributors
        
          -  Open

  - Discussion on potential new use cases for the D\&I use cases (e.g.:
    Hyperledger). \[Objective \#1\]
    
      - > What needs to happen for Hyperledger to become a pilot
        > project?
        
          - Examples OpenStack - Daniel’s suggestion is to start with
            one focus area, the one most useful, easiest and move
            forward. Data for governance, for example, is it useful for
            the board, community. Will it help the board make decisions,
            become more inclusive. 
        
          - Nicole: Hyperledger interested in doing D\&I work, measuring
            it, follow OpenStack example. 
        
          - Daniel: we don’t know how much work involved in a use case
            from both sides - start small with one focus area. 
        
          - Nicole: initial D\&I work had deadlines around OpenStack
            Summits, writing blogs around the work. Event specific to
            Hyperledger community. 
        
          - Sarah: Hyperledger events in 2019 - what can project commit
            to, focus on? Might be an opportunity for D\&I focus. 
        
          - Nicole: OpenStack reports covered majority of metric
            categories in CHAOSS D\&I work. 
        
          - Understand Hyperledger goals and how they match to CHAOSS
            D\&I goals. Copied from WG repo:
            
              - > Goal: Identify how we are communicating with
                > contributors, and potential contributors.
            
              - > Goal: Identify the diversity of the contributions
                > within a community, and how those different
                > contributions are valued.
            
              - > Goal: Identify the diversity and inclusion at events.
        
          - CHAOSS D\&I serve as consultants for Hyperledger project
            once goals identified. 
        
          - **AI Sarah:** Contact Hyperledger project and discuss which
            focus group is most interesting for the project to start
            with. 
        
          - **AI Sarah:** Schedule an in-person meeting at OSLS. Dawn
            will be there, happy to help. 
        
          - Georg: Is there anything CHAOSS D\&I should do/prepare? 
        
          - Sarah: Is there any success from OpenStack that exists to
            share? 
        
          - Nicole: Is there one case study to share? We don’t have that
            yet. Point to the different blogs about the OpenStack
            Report. Share this with Hyperledger team/members.

          - Nicole: suggest others share how they contribute so that
            others will understand quickly what we are doing and how to
            get involved. 
          - Georg: it is important, but if you are completely metrics
            are important. 
          - Dawn: will metrics be confusing without a lot of context?
            That was argument for putting it down lower. 
          - Matt: how to get involved, showcase that as a use case and
            then people who might not really want to get involved but
            might want to know how to use the metrics for their own
            project. 
          - Sarah: trying to reach two audiences, both important. 
          - Dawn: Ben had best practices on this. 
          - Georg: a sentence on purpose, goals, outcomes, process, then
            link to section below. So when you are new to ReadMe get
            high-level view quickly.
          - Is Comm and Contribution in the right place (lower at spot
            13)? George that is where I expect to see them. Dawn: read
            about goals before jumping into contributing to better
            understand if they want to contribute. Resolved this is the
            right place for it.

(Emma)

Sorry I can’t stay today.

I wanted to circle back on the [*contribution type work from
Georg*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/153), and
conversation. And I am wondering, if we’re sometimes creating metrics
that we need, because they don’t exist in CHAOSS yet... so that we can
then apply the d\&I lens. And this might add bloat to or repo/content.

Basically, if someone new were to look across CHAOSS, for metrics that
involve contribution would D\&I be an obvious choice? I’m not sure. 
What I am suggesting we discuss, is how we abstract d\&I from other
metrics. We can still build them, just deliberate about where.

\*hopes this is translates, and makes sense in text\* - 

Georg: Thanks Emma, I will add contribution type to our agenda
