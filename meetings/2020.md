  - Reply from Angela Brown from LF Events to our recommendations on the
    dis/ability question on the registration forms:
    
      - > *“Thank you to you and the CHAOSS D\&I WG members for your
        > efforts here which are much appreciated. We will put all of
        > your recommendations in place, and the latter two will be

        > Linux Foundation
        
          - The CHAOSS D\&I WG made the following recommendations:
            
              - > 1\. Ask for clarification on what seemed intrusive so
                > we can better respond to it.
            
              - > 2\. Reframe the question around how we can accommodate
                > people: Do you have a dis/ability we should be mindful
                > of as we try to accommodate everyone?
            
              - > 3\. Group the question away from the demographic
                > questions and with the other accommodation questions
                > like about food intolerance.

Notes: 

  - Are all metrics that are in the continuous release cycle and have
    passed their review period on the website and the spreadsheet? ---
    the real question is whether there has been comments we need or want
    to address -- the metric stays under review until our next release.

          - *\[Angela:\] I had a community member (he is involved in
            several of our projects, and works at a member company)
            reach out and tell me he thought our disability related
            questions on our event registration forms were too
            intrusive. I have explained why we collect the data and that
            the questions are 100% optional, confidential and were part
            of a list of recommended questions we received from the
            CHAOSS workgroup, but I also told him I'd research this a
            bit more. Would you mind asking the group what they think? A
            screenshot of these questions is attached.*

  -   -   -   - > \[Georg:\] The intention behind this question’s design
                > was to empower people with multiple disabilities to

                > put in a collective box (a simple yes/no question -

                > choice). Accommodating each disability type at an

                > space on the screen.
        
          - Question: is the question about accommodating people or just
            interesting to know that we have diversity at the event?
            
              - > Suggestion:

              - > Since the person sharing feedback was not specific
                > about why it was intrusive, we have to assume their
                > discomfort was from lack of understanding why this
                > data is being collected.
            
              - > Separate out the “want to know diversity” questions

                  - Maybe instead of asking about their disability, ask
                    which accommodations they would like to use.
        
          - The CHAOSS D\&I WG makes the following recommendations:
            
              - > 1\. Ask for clarification on what seemed intrusive so
                > we can better respond to it.
            
              - > 2\. Reframe the question around how we can accommodate
                > people: Do you have a dis/ability we should be mindful
                > of as we try to accommodate everyone?
            
              - > 3\. Group the question away from the demographic
                > questions and with the other accommodation questions
                > like about food intolerance.

          - Question: Where have you reached out to recruit reviewers?
        
          - Goal number of reviewers: 10+
        
          - We currently have reviewers: 3 or 4
        
          - Elizabeth and Matt S have been working on an email to invite
            people.

      - > Managing the notification flood for reviewers
        
          - JWF: Expectation-setting might help with this. I signed up
            to volunteer but was overwhelmed by GitHub emails (even
            though I loved the work -- it was just too much for me to
            keep up with\!)
          - Justin suggest un-watching the repository or the
            organization and relying only on the tagged messages (bot
            auto-tags reviewers when they need to take actions)
    
      - > Experience from Fedora project about Testing new releases
        
          - One day per week dedicated to “TEST DAY”
        
          - Well-documented and communicated expectations and tutorials
        
          - Outreach ahead of the day to get participants
        
          - On test day provide ample support to new contributors

          - *JWF*: I think burnout could be measured, because there is
            often invisible work to a community that is poorly
            understood.
          - *JWF*: I think people who burn out are often doing more work
            than people might realize (not always true, but I think
            often)
    
      - > *Eriol*: but I think some metrics ideas re. Burnout might be:

Magali Ngouabou**

My name is Magali Ngouabou and I am part of a research team at Carnegie
Mellon University seeking to learn more about familiarity and
accessibility of open source to Black and other underrepresented
individuals to enhance access to employment opportunities through open
source. Can you help us send this survey to the people in your
organization, inviting them to participate in our study? That includes
alums, current participants, program organizers, or anyone else who you
think would be relevant to the study.

Survey link:[
](http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6Wk8vBXFfeuxjX7)[*http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6Wk8vBXFfeuxjX7*](http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6Wk8vBXFfeuxjX7)

Open source refers to the method of creating software in collaborative
spaces such as GitHub, GitLab, etc. Surveys suggest minority
representation in open source is low, but there is virtually no
information on the Black experience in these spaces.

These past few months have been especially difficult on the Black
community, and we fully acknowledge that this research is coming at a
time where the population for this survey is under even more pain and
stress than usual. In light of this, we truly appreciate your support in
connecting with your organization’s members as any insight from the
community would be helpful.

  - Ethics Statement
    
      - > Make a CHAOSS statement about privacy and ethics around
        > metrics and analytics
        
          - We can make a disclaimer in our metrics release:
            
              - > The CHAOSS project recognizes that there are ethical
                > and legal challenges when using the metrics and
                > software provided by the community. The specific
                > challenges arise in the use that is specific to your
                > context. 
                
                  - Ethical challenges are around protecting our
                    community members and empowering them with their
                    personal information.
                  - Legal challenges are around GDPR and similar laws
                    that protect personal information of our community
                    members.

          - Starting with Documentation Utility

**Workspace**:

**May 4 -- date for application, identify mentors for each proposal  
**See [*Season of Docs
Timeline*](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline)

**Proposal 1**:

Title: **Write a conceptual overview of CHAOSS D\&I metrics and refactor
existing documentation**

**Description**: Work with CHAOSS D\&I working group members to develop
a conceptual framing for D\&I metrics. The work so far has focused on
defining individual metrics, resulting in much detail that is not
uniformly presented. A technical writer can improve the information
architecture, revise how a reader can drill down into the details, and
make it easier to understand D\&I metrics as a whole. The documentation
would be collected in the CHAOSS D\&I repository and could additionally
be prepared for other dissemination forms to reach a wider audience. 

**Knowledge/Skills Involved**: Being a good human with good ethics.
GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Workflow, HTML Inlines/Tables,
Vector/Raster Images Requirements.

**Aims of the project**: Make the work of the CHAOSS D\&I Working Group
more available.

**Mentors**: Georg Link
([*linkgeorg@gmail.com*](mailto:linkgeorg@gmail.com)); Matt Germonprez
([*germonprez@gmail.com*](mailto:germonprez@gmail.com)) 

**References**: https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion

**License**: MIT

**Proposal 2**:

**Title**: Build documentation for D\&I Badging project

**Description**: The CHAOSS Diversity and Inclusion Badging Program
began as a way to ensure that D\&I metrics can have a significant impact
on the ways that communities function. The aim of the CHAOSS D\&I
Badging program is to bring D\&I metrics into use for propelling good
D\&I practices in different open source systems.

This project will focus on framing documentation for the D\&I Badging
program and aligning it in such a way that it makes sense after
translation. This work would focus on more community-facing docs related
to Badging and also on existing Markdown files.

**Knowledge/Skills Involved**: Citizen of the world with editorial
affinity across languages, GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Workflow, HTML
Inlines/Tables, Vector/Raster Image Requirements.

**Aims of the project**: Write and structure D\&I Badging documentation.
Prepare documentation for easy translation.

**Mentors**: **Mentors**: Saleh A.M., Matt S., Aastha Bist
([*chaoss-badging@googlegroups.com*](mailto:chaoss-badging@googlegroups.com))

**Workspace/Discussion**: 

  - CHAOSScon session about D\&I -- workshop?
    
      - > D\&I Badging was accepted to OSSNA

      - > Work the Implementation section in Documentation Accessibility
        
          - [*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaKDksmuoi6nhaduZ4F96mTwQJvIFnfI8BqLx4MRO38/edit\#heading=h.7c8aneuch0wb*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaKDksmuoi6nhaduZ4F96mTwQJvIFnfI8BqLx4MRO38/edit#heading=h.7c8aneuch0wb)
          - The whole document has become rather complex with all the
            different objectives we identified.
          - It would be good to separate the objectives into logical
            groups and then have matching data collection strategies.
          - the goal is to have more manageable document that does not
            confuse the reader
          - There may be an overlap between the objectives.

      - > GSoC microtasks question. (Posten in
        > badging/diversity-and-inclusion issue \#1)
        
          - In Q 0 of the microtask, there's the term 'software badge'
            which has been used. It is in relation to badges created
            using IMS standards. The question itself is about how the
            IMS standards can be helpful in creating a software
            badge.

I have a doubt about what that term might refer
            to. Does it refer to an independent badge? Or is it more
            like creation of a badge which is associated with a
            particular software's metadata?

Notes:

  - Reflect on Metric Release

          - Capacity Differences of contributors
          - How we might want to consider to include capacity
            differences
          - Sponsorship is about empowerment, especially when protégés
            have differences
    
      - > New metrics?

      - > How are released metrics being validated and tested?
        
          - Proposal from Emma for a Toolkit:
            [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues/252*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues/252)
        
          - Maybe ask users of metrics to write a blog post to share
            their experiences.
            
              - > Idea for a blog post series
                > [*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9FZM6rixjiEsxXQ7Ij-mbGCJKm\_OrOQ6nd3oIBRnto/edit\#heading=h.i08ikslakwjv*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9FZM6rixjiEsxXQ7Ij-mbGCJKm_OrOQ6nd3oIBRnto/edit#heading=h.i08ikslakwjv)
            
              - > Podcast as another venue for this.
        
          - How are people collecting metrics and feeding them into
            systems for using the metrics?
            
              - > There is currently a disconnect between collecting a
                > metric and how to roll it out and put data back into
                > “the system”
    
      - > Where are the metrics implemented? Augur or GrimoireLab?
        
          - Augur and GrimoireLab are not implementing D\&I metrics
            right now.
          - D\&I Badging would be an implementation in the future
          - Emma’s Toolkit proposal promises to be an easy way for
            people to deploy the metrics in their own projects.

  - D\&I Badging Process (Matt S., and Saleh A. M.)
    
      - > The idea is to give projects who work with D\&I metrics to
        > show recognition on their repos and websites that they are
        > proud to use CHAOSS D\&I metrics. The Badging for events is
        > the next step in which a minimum standard will be ensured.
    
      - > Work will be done in:
        > [*https://github.com/Nebrethar/Docs-Diversity-Inclusion-Badging*](https://github.com/Nebrethar/Docs-Diversity-Inclusion-Badging)
    
      - > The Badging process was thinking to be through a GitHub Issue
        > at first
    
      - > Other approach could be through a pull request, so that we
        > have a permanent history and documentation.
    
      - > Two different badges: (i) for events; (ii) for projects.
    
      - > The templates match up to the released metrics. It seems that
        > we have the basic elements in place.
    
      - > The separation of badges into events and projects makes sense
        > for OpenStack project (Amy’s feedback)
    
      - > When a PR is made, it has two components: 
        
          - 1\. a markdown page that is based on the template
          - 2\. an entry in the list of passing badges (and linking to
            the markdown file)
    
      - > Implementation question? Will we be passing out badges or
        > providing a link?
        
          - How will we make sure that people displaying a badge are
            conforming?
          - We need to explore technical implementation.
          - Possibly use the CII best practices badge app?
          - [*https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects*](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects)
          - We could change the criteria for the D\&I badging
            requirements
          - If we want the PR process, then maybe we could enter a
            project into a customized version of the Best Practices
            Badge system.
