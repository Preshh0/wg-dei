# Communication Inclusivity

**Goal:** Identify how we are communicating with contributors, and potential contributors.

Name | Question
--- | ---
Listening | How well do our mechanisms for listening accommodate community?
Speaking| Are we speaking to our communities in an accessible range (i.e. Non-English speakers, captioning, age group)?  
Mode Alternatives | What alternative communication modes do we offer?
Captioning | Do we provide text captioning for spoken communication?
Technical Jargon |   Are we attentive to project specific-language that may discourage new community members? 

Note: These metrics have not been developed yet.
