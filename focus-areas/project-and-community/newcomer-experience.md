# Newcomer Experience

Question: How well does an open source community attend to welcoming newcomers? 

## Description
Projects want to provide an environment in which new community members can actively listen, engage, and contribute to an open source community. Newcomer experience (e.g., onboarding and orientation) is a way of measuring and understanding how open source communities welcome and support new community members. 

## Objectives
- Determine how your community is designed to improve the experience of new community members 
- Determine how effective the documentation is in helping new community members take the first steps to become independent contributors
- Determine how your community recognizes and supports new community members 
- Determine how your community provides resources for new community members
- Determine potential areas for improvement in diversity, equity, and incluion issues for new community members in particular

## Implementation

### Filters
The newcomer experience can be filtered on: 
- [Member Demographics](https://chaoss.community/metric-project-demographics/) 
- [Types of Contributions](https://chaoss.community/metric-types-of-contributions/)  
- Amount of a person’s open source experience 
- Time between a person’s first and subsequent engagements within a project
- [New contributors](https://chaoss.community/metric-new-contributors/) 
- [Occasional contributors](https://chaoss.community/metric-occasional-contributors/) 
- [Inactive contributors](https://chaoss.community/metric-inactive-contributors/) 

### Tools Providing the Metric
- [Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur)   
- [GrimoireLab](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab)

### Data Collection Strategies

#### Quantitative 
- Observe second, third, or fourth contributions from first-time contributors
- Observe [New Contributors Closing Issues](https://chaoss.community/?p=3615) to determine if new contributors are able to close issues

#### Qualitative 
- Survey: This could include newcomer experience questions such as:
  - Survey Likert item (1-x): I feel welcome in the community
  - Survey Likert item (1-x): I feel like I am making a contribution to the community
  - Survey Likert item (1-x): I am satisfied with the current community structure
  - Survey Likert item (1-x): I would like to help more in the community
  - Survey Likert item (1-x): I have the ability to have an impact in the community 
  - Survey Likert item (1-x): The community treats new community members well 
  - Open ended question: What's something that the community lacks and you wish it didn't (e.g., more in-person events, more research on DEI, more meetings)?
  - Open ended question: When you first started working with the community, what were some obstacles you encountered (e.g., couldn't find information on getting started, couldn't find meeting times, wasn't sure where to start)?
- Effectiveness of Mentorship programs specifically aimed at supporting newcomers.
- Effectiveness of Newcomer onboarding training 
- Effectiveness of Peer-to-peer mentorship programs internal to the community
- Effectiveness of Project Documentation through related metrics:
  - [Documentation Discoverability](https://chaoss.community/metric-documentation-discoverability/)
  - [Documentation Accessibility](https://chaoss.community/metric-documentation-accessibility/)
  - [Documentation Usability](https://chaoss.community/metric-documentation-usability/)
