# Event Location Inclusivity

Question: Is the event located in a region where governments, cultural contexts, or society may cause harm to the physical safety and/or psychological safety of event attendees?

## Description
Many parts of the world are difficult or dangerous for individuals from marginalized groups of society to visit. Cultural differences, civil unrest, and local legislation may restrict the rights of some event attendees. For example, many regions have enacted legislation that limits the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. At the most extreme side, it can impact the safety of the individuals or cause them to leave the proposed event location. Increasingly, corporations and funding agencies are restricting travel and denying travel funding to regions that enact discriminatory legislation. 

Event organizers should also be aware of any conflicting events in the local area that may bring harm to their attendees. For example, there may be events occurring at the same time nearby that promote bigotry, racism, homophobia, and hate. 

## Objectives
This metric may be used to ensure that the event location selected is safe and inclusive for all event attendees. If an event’s location cannot be controlled due to financial or travel constraints, this metric may also be used to communicate the organizer’s position on the local laws, support for the community, and safety warnings to event attendees.

- Attendees of an event may want to know how inclusive an event location is before registering and attending. 
- Sponsors of an event may want to know how inclusive an event location is before providing support. 
- Event organizers may want to signal disruptions to inclusivity so that attendees and sponsors can make informed decisions.

### Data Collection Strategies

Event organizers can answer the following about their event and share this information with potential event attendees and sponsors:

1. Has the event's region or geographic location been placed on a list of places of concern for any of the following demographics?
 - Sexual and gender minorities
 - People with disabilities
 - Racial and ethnic minorities
 - Women
 - Religious minorities

2. Are there any other events happening in the same location at the same time as your event that could potentially bring harm to a subset of any attendees?
3. In what ways does the event communications address or acknowledge any cause for concern for marginalized attendees?
4. What are the financial costs associated with attending the event?
5. How geographically accessible is the event location? 
6. Are there religious holidays and observations occurring at same time as the event?
7. What are the visa-related issues with traveling to the event?
8. Are there known air quality concerns at the event location? 
9. What are the public transport options at the event location?
10. Does the venue have documented labor disputes?
11. What is the demographic diversity at the event location?
12. What accessibility accommodations does the event provide?

Event organizers can include a post-conference question asking attendees about event location inclusivity.
