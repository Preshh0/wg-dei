# Diversity Access Tickets

Question: How are Diversity Access Tickets used to support diversity and inclusion for an event?

## Description

Diversity access tickets can enable community members to attend events and encourage new members to join. Especially unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise economically disadvantaged people may otherwise be excluded from attending an event. Furthermore, diversity access tickets can encourage additional contributions and ongoing contributions. These tickets may be discounted to add further incentive for members of the invited groups to attend. A popular example is reduced tickets for students. This metric is applicable to virtual, in-person, or hybrid events.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate effectiveness of increasing diversity at events.
- Enable attendees to attend who could not without a discount due to their economic situation.
- Encourage members from underrepresented groups to attend.
- Track effectiveness of outreach efforts.

### Data Collection Strategies

**Observe website for availability and pricing of diversity access tickets:**
- How many different diversity access tickets are available?
- What are the different types of diversity access tickets provided? 
- What are the criteria for qualifying for a diversity access ticket?
- What is the price difference between regular and diversity access tickets?
- Are regular attendees encouraged to sponsor diversity access tickets?
- Are sponsors of diversity access tickets named?
- Are numbers of diversity access tickets provided from previous conferences displayed on an event websited?

**Interview organizers:**

- What are the criteria for qualifying for a diversity access ticket?
- How many attendees used diversity access tickets?
- Where did you advertise diversity access tickets?
- If any, who sponsored diversity access tickets?  

**Survey participants about perception of diversity access tickets:**
- Likert scale [1-x] item: The availability of discounted student [replace with whatever group was invited] tickets was effective in increasing participation of students [or other group].
- True/False item: I was aware that [this event] provided diversity access tickets.
- True/False/Don't Know item: I qualified for a diversity access ticket.
- True/False item: A diversity access ticket enabled me to attend [this event].  

**Track attendance numbers based on diversity access tickets:**  
- Count use of different discount codes to track outreach effectiveness and which groups make use of the diversity access tickets. This does require a conference registration system that tracks the use of discount codes.
