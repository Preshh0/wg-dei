# Event Demographics

Question: To what extent does an event consider and pay attention to attendee, speaker, and volunteer demographics?

## Description

Attendee, Speaker, and Volunteer [demographics](https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics) help indicate the potential for different viewpoints and broader perspectives and representation at an event. Because everyone has a different perspective, investigating the responses for each group of people can indicate whether they feel less included than the average. This metric is applicable to virtual, in-person, and hybrid events.

## Objectives

- Be attentive to the [diversity] (https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics) of attendees, speakers, and volunteers.
- Help retain attendees, speakers, and volunteers from diverse backgrounds for future events.
- Be attentive that groups of speakers are diverse when grouped by keynotes, sessions, and tracks.
- Be attentive that keynote, track, and session selection committees are diverse.
- If collecting and/or sharing attendee, speaker, and volunteer demographic information, creating a statement of privacy management of demographic information. 
- Discover less-visible stories with regard to intersectionality of the demographic data.

## Implementation

### Filters
- Demographics: Responses to subjective questions should be analyzed to gather diverse perspectives. Investigating the responses for each group of demographics can indicate whether some demographics feel less included than the average.
- Keynotes, sessions, and tracks.
- Diversity throughout the conference that is not restricted to a single track or series.
- Attendees
- Speakers
- Volunteers
- Conference Committee

### Data Collection Strategies

Note that demographic information is sensitive information and if you are using this metric, you should pay particular attention to the (CHAOSS Data Use Statement)[https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/data-use-statement.md]. Several options exist to collect demographic information. These options include: 

- Request attendee and speaker [demographics](http://nikkistevens.com/open-demographics/) during conference registration with an option to opt-out of providing information.
- Use a survey before, during, or after an event to gather attendee and speaker demographics. (For example, using the [Open Demographics questions](http://nikkistevens.com/open-demographics/))
- For virtual events: If a virtual event platform supports real-time polling, use polls to better understand the audience and background of people who attend your event.
