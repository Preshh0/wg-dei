# Code of Conduct for Project

Question: How does the Code of Conduct for the project support diversity and inclusion?

## Description

A code of conduct signals to project members what behavior is acceptable. A code of conduct also provides enforcement mechanisms to deal with people who misbehave.


## Objectives

A code of conduct in a project provides the following: 

- Knowing that a community takes diversity and inclusion seriously.
- Evaluating a community for diverse and inclusive design, before investing any time in that project.
- Identifying whether or not their demographic is protected prior to participating in a project.
- Ensuring that project partnerships, and allies take diversity and inclusion seriously as it can impact their own reputation and community health.
- Understanding how a violation is reported and handled.
- Observing that the code of conduct is being enforced; and not just the potential for enforcement.

## Implementation
*The usage and dissemination of health metrics may lead to privacy violations. Organizations may be exposed to risks. These risks may flow from compliance with the GDPR in the EU, with state law in the US, or with other law. There may also be contractual risks flowing from terms of service for data providers such as GitHub and GitLab. The usage of metrics must be examined for risk and potential data ethics problems. Please see [CHAOSS Data Ethics document](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/data-use-statement.md) for additional guidance.*

### Tools Providing the Metric

* [Mozilla Code of Conduct Assessment Tool](https://mozilla.github.io/diversity-coc-review.io/)

### Data Collection Strategies

- Identify the location of the code of conduct as it pertains to primary areas of interaction and participation in projects and events (i.e., repo root, event entrance, communication channels).
- Survey project members about their perception of how a code of conduct influences their participation and sense of safety.
- Follow-up survey for reporting, around discoverability, clarity, and relevance.

_Qualitative_

- Code of Conduct passes Mozillaâ€™s Code of Conduct Assessment Tool
- Interview and/or survey community members to understand more about why the code of conduct does or does not meet their expectations.
  * What can the project do to improve the code of conduct?
  * What are some examples of how this community met or exceeded your code of conduct expectations?

_Quantitative_

- Browse the project website. If code of conduct is posted and there is a clear avenue for reporting violations, this criteria is fulfilled. (Note: ideally, the code of conduct would be discoverable)
- Survey participants about the code of conduct:
  * Likert scale [1-x] item: How well did the project meet your code of conduct expectations?
  * Likert scale [1-x] item: How clear are you on the rights and responsibilites of community members as described in the code of conduct?
  * Were you made aware of the code of conduct and how to report violations? [i]
  * Did the existence of the code of conduct make you feel safer, and more empowered to fully participate in this project? [i]
  * If you reported a violation of the code of conduct, was it resolved to your satisfaction? [i]
